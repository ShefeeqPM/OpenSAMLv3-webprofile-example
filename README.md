Reference implementation for the book, "A guide to OpenSAML V3" 

The book is availible here: https://blog.samlsecurity.com/a-guide-to-opensamlv3.html

The sole purpose of the sample project is to illustrate the function of OpenSAML. 
Although, it can be a very good place to start when experimenting with OpenSAML, it should not be used for production purposes.
